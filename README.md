# ELEVATOR EXERCISE

Live version from `main` branch ðŸ‘‰ https://elevators-lai9.vercel.app/

## Solution explanation

To solve this task, I decided to create classes, which would represent physical devices in the real world. Well, at least
simplified versions of the devices :) 

There's an elevator class, that represents things that only elevator can know. It can go up, down or stay still. You
can tell elevator which floor to go. Elevator can tell whether it can even go there and how far the called floor is, 
including current elevators route.

The, there's a controller, which is brain for the buttons to call elevator. It can have multiple elevators, even elevators
with different tunnel height. It keeps all the calls to floors and decide which elevator to send where. Building can have
multiple of these, for example in different ends of the building.

Rendering of the view happens when anything happens either on the controller or elevator. This will call Tick function,
that will trigger re-rendering.

Elevators and controllers are dynamic, and it is possible to add these as many as you like in the code.
It will render everything automatically and all of it will work.

Since there was no forms except the button, I didn't used radix or form hooks. Also, due how much
time already it took, I kept simplified UI.

## PART 1 â€“ Setup base solution according to Standards

You are required to create a base solution according to the standards below:

### 1. General requirements

a. The solution structure and code should be developed using best practices.

b. Use design patterns acceptable for React and TypeScript.

c. Add at least one test

d. Use best practices to split the application into components.

e. Optional - Add some simple visualization (such as downloading an image for a floor or a sound for when the elevator arrives).



### 2. Preferred tools, technologies, and packages:

a. React, Typescript, HTML, CSS

b. Responsive design, styled-components.

c. Styled System, theme-ui, radix forms , react-form-hook

d. Vite package manager

e. Jest testing package

   
## PART 2 â€“ The Application

You are required to write an elevator control software that contains the following parts:

1. UI - It should display a building with floors separated by numbers and an elevator image. When a floor is clicked, the elevator should be called to that floor. The UI should display a moving elevator that stops at a particular floor.
2. Logic - When the first person calls the elevator, it starts to move. So, a non-limited number of people on different floors can call the elevator, and the elevator will arrive at the floor in the order it was called. When multiple elevators exist in the same building, and a person calls an elevator, you should detect the one that can arrive faster.

### Example 1:
`
A person calls the elevator on floor 7, and it is moving. Elevator number 1 starts moving and is now passing floor 2. Another person calls the elevator on floor 5, but since elevator 1 needs to arrive at floor 7 first, elevator 2 starts moving.
`

### Example 2:
`
A person calls the elevator on floor 7, and elevator number 1 has now stopped at floor 7. Another person calls the elevator on floor 5. In this case, elevator number 1 is closer to the person, and they will be picked up from floor 5.
`

The solution should be dynamic, so the UI should be able to display a dynamic number of buildings with a dynamic
number of elevators.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   }
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
